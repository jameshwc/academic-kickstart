I was asked to develop a program to dump data from MSSQL and import it to PostgreSQL, and it's used to import data via the platform's API as well.

I finished it within only half of the time my supervisor estimated.

Then instead of letting time slip away, I initiatively got myself another job: cooperate with the other intern to deploy the test environment automatically in merely one-line command, with ansible and docker.

After summer, I currently work on gitlab CI/CD pipelines for the platform.

All the work results are available on my github."""
